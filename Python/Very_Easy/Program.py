# How Edabit Works
# This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the Code tab above you'll see a starter function that looks like this:
# def hello():
# All you have to do is type return "hello edabit.com" on the second line and then click the Check button. If you did this correctly, the button will turn red and say SUBMIT FINAL. Click it and see what happens.

# def hello():
#     return "hello edabit.com"

# print(hello())




# Return the Sum of Two Numbers
# Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

# def addition(a, b):
#     return a + b

# print(addition(3, 2))
# print(addition(-3, -6))
# print(addition(7, 3))



# Return the Next Number from the Integer Passed
# Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result.

def addition(num):
    num = num + 1
    return num

print(addition(0))
print(addition(9))
print(addition(-3))
